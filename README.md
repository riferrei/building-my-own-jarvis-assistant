# Building my own J.A.R.V.I.S assistant

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to create a [J.A.R.V.I.S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.A.R.V.I.S.) assistant deployed as an Alexa skill. Built using Java, LangChain4J, AWS Lambda, and Redis Cloud, it enables Alexa to recall past conversations and deliver contextual, intelligent responses. It showcases how to implement a memory and semantic-caching layer for AI assistants, enriching the natural language experience through state persistence and fast retrieval.

#### Redis Agent Memory Setup
1. Log in to [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/try-free) and navigate to the **Agent Memory** section.
2. Create a new memory store and note the **API URL**, **API key**, and **Store ID**.
3. Set these as the `redis_agent_memory_api_url`, `redis_agent_memory_api_key`, and `redis_agent_memory_store_id` variables in your `terraform.tfvars`.

#### Redis LangCache Setup

#### Installation & Deployment
Once configured, deploy everything using:
```sh
./deploy.sh
```

When the deployment completes, note the output values including the Lambda ARN and function URL.

You can verify if the Agent Memory service is reachable by saying:

> “Alexa, ask my jarvis to check the memory server.”

## Running the Demo

Once the deployment is complete, you can interact with your Alexa skill named **my jarvis**.

### 🗣️ Examples of interactions
- "Alexa, tell my javis to remember that my favorite programming language is Java."
- "Alexa, ask my jarvis to recall if Java is my favorite programming language."
- "Alexa, tell my jarvis to remember I have a doctor appointment next Monday at 10 AM."
- "Alexa, ask my jarvis to suggest what should I do for my birthday party."

### Teardown
To remove all deployed resources:
```sh
./undeploy.sh
```

## Slide Deck
📑 [Beyond Prompting: Context Engineering for Production-Grade AI](./slides/slides.pdf)    
Covers demo goals, motivations for a memory layer, and architecture overview.

## Architecture
![Software Architecture](./images/software-architecture.png)
This architecture uses an Alexa skill written in Java and hosted as an AWS Lambda function. The Lambda implements a stream handler that processes user requests and responses, using Redis Agent Memory and Redis LangCache — which are managed services on Redis Cloud — as its backend layer.

![Chat Assistant Service](./assets/chat-assistant-service.png)
As part of the stream handler implementation, it uses a Chat Assistant Service that leverages LangChain4J to manage interactions with Redis Agent Memory. This service implements context engineering, ensuring that conversations are enriched with relevant historical data retrieved from Redis. OpenAI is the LLM used to process and generate responses.

## Known Issues
- Alexa Developer Console may require manual linking if credentials are not fully synchronized.
